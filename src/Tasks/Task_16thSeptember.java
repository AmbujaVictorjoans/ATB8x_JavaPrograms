        * Example: int a = 10; int --> datatype; a --> variable_name; = --> assignment operator; 10 = literal;
        * == is a Relational Operator and it compares two values and gives a true or false result (boolean)
         *Example boolean c = (45 == 45); (Both Assignment and Relational Operator are used here)
